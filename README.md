# IMLearn-Project

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and investigations of machine learning concepts as part of the IMLearn coursework. It includes Python scripts for gradient descent, logistic regression, and learning rate experiments, along with supporting documentation.

## Files
- `modules.py`: Core module definitions.
- `learning_rate.py`: Experiments with learning rate optimization.
- `logistic_regression.py`: Logistic regression implementation.
- `gradient_descent.py`: Gradient descent algorithm.
- `gradient_descent_investigation.py`: Analysis of gradient descent behavior.
- `Answers.pdf`: Written responses or project answers.
- `images/`: Screenshots or visualizations (e.g., profile screenshot).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone "https://github.com/AmirKelman/ML-Learning-Experiments.git"
2. Navigate to the folder and run the scripts using Python:
  cd IMLearn-Project
  python learning_rate.py

 ## Notes
- Ensure Python and required libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.
- The image in the `images/` folder is a reference screenshot (e.g., profile or output visualization).
